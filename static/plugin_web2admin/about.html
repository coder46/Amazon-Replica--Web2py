<h1>web2admin</h1>

<p>This is a simple <a href="http://www.web2py.com">web2py</a> administration plugin.</p>
<p>It is heavily using the features provided by web2py SQLFORM.smartgrid featuring extensive search, actions, history, custom navigation links, pagination and various customizations. </p>
<p>It takes security very seriously and uses both groups and permissions for fine-grained access control.</p>
